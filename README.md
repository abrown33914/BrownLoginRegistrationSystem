Final Project for COP2006 - Programming I

The goal of this project is to create a simple login/registration system to implement into programs as to identify users and their 
individual information within the system. It will allow the user to create an account with a unique username and password, as well as 
login to their individual accounts with their username and password. Additionally, the system works to keep private data(passwords) 
secure and takes actions to keep this data from floating in the program publicly.

The purpose of this project was to create a login and registration system that can be implemented into many different projects. It allows
users to create and log into accounts that have the ability to contain data from other projects (such as bank account information, work 
schedule, etc.). It was created using C++17 with standard C++ libraries and the CLion IDE. The program holds the registered users in class 
objects, which are stored in a vector. From the main menu, the program utilizes a multitude of functions in order to complete each desired 
task. Overall, the program works well, and all known bugs have been fixed.
