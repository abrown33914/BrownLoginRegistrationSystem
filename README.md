- Banking applications 🏦
- Work schedule management ⏳
- Personal data tracking 📊

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++17
- **IDE**: CLion
- **Libraries**: Standard C++ libraries

## 🏗️ Implementation Details
- **User accounts** are stored as **class objects** in a dynamic **vector**.
- A **main menu** provides intuitive navigation between different functionalities.
- The program leverages **multiple functions** to handle login, registration, and data security efficiently.
- **Robust error handling** ensures smooth execution and prevents crashes.

## 🛡️ Security Features
🔒 **Password Protection** – User passwords are not displayed or stored in plain text.
🔒 **Data Privacy** – Sensitive user data remains hidden from public access within the program.

## ✅ Project Status
🎉 The project is **fully functional**, with all known bugs resolved! Ready for implementation in various applications.
